# Supported languages

aider_vox should work well with most popular coding languages.
This is because top LLMs are fluent in most mainstream languages,
and familiar with popular libraries, packages and frameworks.

aider_vox has specific support for linting many languages.
By default, aider_vox runs the built in linter any time a file is edited.
If it finds syntax errors, aider_vox will offer to fix them for you.
This helps catch small code issues and quickly fix them.

aider_vox also does code analysis to help
the LLM navigate larger code bases by producing
a [repository map](https://aider_vox.chat/docs/repomap.html).
aider_vox can currently produce repository maps for many popular
mainstream languages, listed below.

## How to add support for another language

aider_vox should work quite well for other languages, even those
without repo map or linter support.
You should really try coding with aider_vox before
assuming it needs better support for your language.

That said, if aider_vox already has support for linting your language,
then it should be possible to add repo map support.
To build a repo map, aider_vox needs the `tags.scm` file
from the given language's tree-sitter grammar.
If you can find and share that file in a 
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider_vox/issues),
then it may be possible to add repo map support.

If aider_vox doesn't support linting, it will be complicated to
add linting and repo map support.
That is because aider_vox relies on 
[py-tree-sitter-languages](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages)
to provide pre-packaged versions of tree-sitter
parsers for many languages.

aider_vox needs to be easy for users to install in many environments,
and it is probably too complex to add dependencies on
additional individual tree-sitter parsers.
